Home automation sketches
===============

Hopefully this little project can grow from the ember that it is right now. 

I currently have a basic sketch that uses various sensors to get the "condition" of the room including motion, sonar, temp, humidity and light pollution.

Next projects:
*Module to do something bsaed on the payload of a MQTT subscription.
